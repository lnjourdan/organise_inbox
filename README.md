What does it do?

The script, written using python, to organise a mess outlook inbox.
It works by going through each email, getting the date/year it was sent and then organising it into a folder/subfolder based on this info.


HOW TO USE

You will need the following installed on your PC:
1. Python (Can be dowbloaded from: https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. pywin32 Library (Can be installed via powershell with the command: pip install pywin32)
3. Microsoft Outlook (Desktop App)

How to run:
1. Open your powershell/command line (can search for this from your task bar)
2. Direct yourself to where you have saved this, most likely your downloads (type this into the powershell: cd C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\downloads)
3. Type the following into your powershell in order to run the script: python organise_inbox.py
4. You should shortly see changes appear within your Outlook App.

Note: I originally wrote this script to organise my own inbox, I had all emails organised into yearly folders, but wanted monthly subfolders for increased clarity.
I have done my best to adaprt the script now so that it will work for users if they are organising directly from the inbox.

Thanks for using!
